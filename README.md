# Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Models  

This repository contains the implementation of reward modeling to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), focusing on improving the quality and alignment of generated responses with specific goals. The project utilizes the Hugging Face `trl` library to train a GPT-2 model for sequence classification and evaluate responses using reward-based techniques.  

## Objectives  
After completing this lab, you will gain the ability to:  
- Understand the fundamentals of reward modeling in machine learning.  
- Preprocess and prepare datasets for reward modeling tasks.  
- Configure and train a GPT-2 model for sequence classification.  
- Implement special tokens in tokenizers for customized training.  
- Evaluate model performance using pairwise comparisons of responses.  
- Align LLM outputs with desired objectives and behaviors.  

## Key Features  
- **Reward Modeling:** Training models to prioritize specific behaviors using defined rewards.  
- **GPT-2 Fine-Tuning:** Configuration and training of a GPT-2 model for sequence classification.
